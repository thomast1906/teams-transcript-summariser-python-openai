# Overview
- **Data Management System**: Discussed infrastructure management, access, configuration, and the role of the Load Balancer.
- **User Management**: Adding/removing accounts, security mirror setup, access nodes, time synchronization servers, and code repository management.
- **New User Setup**: Handling of network access and authentication keys.

# Concerns
**DevOps Tool Versions**: Discrepancy between versions causing inconsistencies.
Access Nodes: Configuration accuracy and connection issues.
**Time Sync Servers**: Potential misconfiguration.

# Current Model
**Access**: Through Load Balancer using internal endpoints.
Configuration: Stored in designated directories, with credentials and sensitive data managed within the system.
**User Management**: Network access and authentication keys stored in the system.

# Questions/Thoughts to Address
**Access Review**: Should there be an audit of who has access to production decryption keys?
Redundancy for Database Credentials: Is it necessary for streamlined certificate updates?
**Concurrent Maintenance**: Can the process be improved to mitigate risks?

# To-Do Lists
**Monitor Network Activity:** Continue observing and managing the high traffic from specific origin.
**Finish API Management Code Migration**: Ensure the transfer of API configurations to code is completed.
**Evaluate Infrastructure Tier:** Assess the necessity of certain virtual machines and services in the infrastructure tier, such as time synchronization servers.

# Outstanding Tasks
**Find Resource Naming Guidelines:** Locate and potentially update the resource naming guidelines in the documentation system.
